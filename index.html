	<h2>Amie Collins</h2>
	<p>I am both a coder and an artist, and have spent 2 years in the UOIT Game Development and Entrepreneurship program. I love cats, music and video games. My favorite band is the band Bleachers and my favorite book is Desiree by Annemarie Selinko. I have many things going on in my life such as my Dialetical Behavioural Therapy group, personal training at Goodlife as well as hopefully a Dungeons and Dragons group. I also have many hobbies such as my online roleplaying community, playing video games and exploring meditation and other "new age" and holistic medicine such as Reiki.</p>
